# A Chapter

## Paragraphs
This is a paragraph. Add a double space at the end of a line  
to make a new line.

## Headings
Six types of headings can be used. In mark up you indicate the level with the number of hashtags. We have used headings 1 and 2 already, so headings' 3 to 6 would be:

### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6


## Emphasis
You can emphasise words in text:  

With two asterisks I can make this **bold** or I can use two underscores __also bold__.  
One asterisk makes an *italic*, just as one underscore _does_.  
We can also use two ~ to ~~strikethrough~~?

## Blockquotes
We can use the blockquotes for quoting very important people:  

> This is a very important resource!  
>  
> > Source: _Me_

## Code
You can insert code chunks to run data tasks or mathematical functions

The convention for converting to metric are inches and feet to centimetres (cm), yards to meters (m), and miles to meters. Formulas for converting are:

$$
in * 2.54
$$
Run some R code for a table (you can also install things to tidy this).
```{r}
head(iris)
```

Basic data visualisation
```{r}
plot(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Sepal.Width)
```


## Lists
We can do an ordered list  

1. Findable  
2. Accessible  
3. Interoperable  
4. Reusable  

Or unordered  

* Accessible
* Reusable
* Findable
* Interoperable

Or we can have nested lists  

1. Findable
  - (Meta)data are assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier
  - Data are described with rich metadata (defined by R1 below)
    - Metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the data they describe
    - (Meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource
2. Accessible
- (Meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardised communications protocol
- The protocol is open, free, and universally implementable
- The protocol allows for an authentication and authorisation procedure, where necessary
- Metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available

## Table
A way to do a quick, static table (You can also use code)  

| Left Align (default) | Center Align | Right Align |
| :------------------- | :----------: | ----------: |
| FAIR assessment      | Easy         | Policy      |
| F-UJI                | Moderate     | Dataset     |
| CoreTrustSeal        | Hard         | Repository  |

## Task List

- [x] FAIR assessment
- [ ] F-UJI
- [ ] CoreTrustSeal

## Footnote
We can have footnotes:  

For example.[^1]

[^1]: and here's the footnote. 

Or do it this way.[^see]

[^see]: Another footnote.

## Citations
You can create manual citations of course. But if you have many citations you can link to a bib file. This also allows you to set a citation format in the index file. Say Chicago or APA.

This also creates a reference list for you. So you can cite [@digitalcurationcentreCurationReferenceManual] and  [@jonesHowDevelopData2011, p. 3]


## Horizontal Lines
You can insert line breaks using three consecutive "***" or "---" or "___". For example:

***


## HTML
Sometimes you need to resort to some HTML code, for example:

<p align="center">You can only center text this way.</p>
