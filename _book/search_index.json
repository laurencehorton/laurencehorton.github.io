Add a double space at the end of a line to make a new line. 3.2 Headings Six types of headings can be used. In mark up you indicate the level with the number of hashtags. We have used headings 1 and 2 already, so headings’ 3 to 6 would be: 3.2.1 Heading 3 3.2.1.1 Heading 4 3.2.1.1.1 Heading 5 3.2.1.1.1.1 Heading 6 3.3 Emphasis You can emphasise words in text: With two asterisks I can make this bold or I can use two underscores also bold. One asterisk makes an italic, just as one underscore does. We can also use two ~ to strikethrough? 3.4 Blockquotes We can use the blockquotes for quoting very important people: This is a very important resource! Source: Me 3.5 Images Picture of Earth from space 3.6 Links The Digital Curation Centre The Digital Curation Centre has some resources There is also a link to the DCC’s conference here 3.7 Code You can insert code chunks to run data tasks or mathematical functions The convention for converting to metric are inches and feet to centimetres (cm), yards to meters (m), and miles to meters. Formulas for converting are: \\[ in * 2.54 \\] Run some R code for a table (you can also install things to tidy this). head(iris) ## Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species ## 1 5.1 3.5 1.4 0.2 setosa ## 2 4.9 3.0 1.4 0.2 setosa ## 3 4.7 3.2 1.3 0.2 setosa ## 4 4.6 3.1 1.5 0.2 setosa ## 5 5.0 3.6 1.4 0.2 setosa ## 6 5.4 3.9 1.7 0.4 setosa Basic data visualisation plot(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Sepal.Width) 3.8 Lists We can do an ordered list Findable Accessible Interoperable Reusable Or unordered Accessible Reusable Findable Interoperable Or we can have nested lists Findable (Meta)data are assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier Data are described with rich metadata (defined by R1 below) Metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the data they describe (Meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource Accessible (Meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardised communications protocol The protocol is open, free, and universally implementable The protocol allows for an authentication and authorisation procedure, where necessary Metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available 3.9 Table A way to do a quick, static table (You can also use code) Left Align (default) Center Align Right Align FAIR assessment Easy Policy F-UJI Moderate Dataset CoreTrustSeal Hard Repository 3.10 Task List FAIR assessment F-UJI CoreTrustSeal 3.11 Footnote We can have footnotes: For example.1 Or do it this way.2 3.12 Citations You can create manual citations of course. But if you have many citations you can link to a bib file. This also allows you to set a citation format in the index file. Say Chicago or APA. This also creates a reference list for you. So you can cite (Digital Curation Centre, n.d.) and (Jones 2011, 3) 3.13 Horizontal Lines You can insert line breaks using three consecutive “***” or “—” or “___“. For example: 3.14 HTML Sometimes you need to resort to some HTML code, for example: You can only center text this way. Digital Curation Centre. n.d. Curation Reference Manual.
